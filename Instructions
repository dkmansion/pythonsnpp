Obtain Neale Pickett's snpplib.py from http://woozle.org/neale/src/python/ (It's not on on his github repo).
snpplib.py (21k)  SNPP client class for Python
Thanks to Neale for the work converting snpplib from smtplib.

Edit pythonsnpp.py 
Edit strings on line 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22 (only if needed, You can delete 21 and 22 if only sending to one user at a time)
Duplicate lines 18 & 19 for each recipient you are messaging in a single send session, otherwise use separate SNPP sessions and message one at a time using line 18, 18 and 23 (delete 21 & 22)

Note: you may need to edit snpplib.py at the end of the file to meet your requirements.  Maybe having a separate snpplib file for each vendor you are delivering messages to.  ie; snpplib_AMS.py, or snpplib_SPOK.py to ensure the localhost string is directed properly.

I used this internally to an SNPP server on a private network and made heavy modifications to the end of the snpplib.py file obtained from Neale Pickett's site.

Goodluck.
